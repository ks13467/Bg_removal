Background Removal App

Welcome to the Background Removal App, a full-stack AI-powered SaaS application. This project allows users to upload images, process them using AI to remove the background, and download the image with a transparent background.

Features

AI-Powered Background Removal: Automatically removes the background from uploaded images using advanced AI algorithms.

User Authentication: Seamlessly integrated authentication and user management using Clerk.

Credit System: Users are allocated credits to process images. Additional credits can be purchased through an integrated online payment system.

Responsive UI: User-friendly and responsive interface built with React.

Full-Stack Architecture: Utilizes MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) for robust performance.


Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB

Authentication: Clerk

AI Model: Background removal powered by machine learning

Payment Integration: Integrated online payment gateway


Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/background-removal-app.git  
cd background-removal-app


2. Install dependencies for both client and server:

# In the root directory  
npm install  
cd client  
npm install  
cd ..


3. Configure environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory. Add the following variables:

MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>  
CLERK_FRONTEND_API=<your-clerk-frontend-api-key>  
CLERK_API_KEY=<your-clerk-api-key>  
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your-stripe-secret-key>



4. Run the application:

# Start the server  
npm run dev  

# In a new terminal, start the client  
cd client  
npm start


5. Access the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.



How It Works

1. User Authentication: Users sign up or log in using Clerk's prebuilt authentication components.


2. Upload Image: Upload an image to the application.


3. Background Removal: The app processes the image and removes the background using AI.


4. Download Image: The processed image with a transparent background is available for download.


5. Credits System: Each image processing deducts credits. Users can purchase more credits if needed.



Future Enhancements

Add support for bulk image uploads.
